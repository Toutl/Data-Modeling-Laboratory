# *Data Modeling Laboratory* Portfolio

---

This repository compiles the Jupyter notebooks developed during the **Data Modeling Lab** course.

The contents are organized into three main folders: `pre-modeling`, `regression`, and `classification`.

The purpose of this portfolio is to compile the exercises completed throughout the course, showcasing the complete data modeling workflow:
from exploratory analysis and dimensionality reduction to the implementation of classical models and neural networks for both regression and classification.
